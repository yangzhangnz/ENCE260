# Fun Kit Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Description
This project is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game designed for the Fun Kit hardware platform. It facilitates a two-player game where participants use the physical buttons on their respective devices to select rock, paper, or scissors. The game results, indicating the winner and loser of each round, are displayed on the LED screen of the Fun Kit devices.
